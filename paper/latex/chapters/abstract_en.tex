\chapter{Abstract}

This study aims to develop a violin performance tracking system 
incorporating a source separation model to achieve mixed source separation 
of violin and piano, 
and to utilize the separated sources for music tracking under different features.

We designed a source separation module and a music tracking module. 
For the source separation module, 
we collected and established a new public integrated dataset to train the Band-Split RNN model, 
and improved the model's band-split method. 
In model evaluation, we used Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) 
to measure the separation performance.
The results show that the model outperforms existing baseline models 
in both data-limit and data-rich cases, 
demonstrating the effectiveness of the band-split method.

For the music tracking module, 
we improved the Online Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (ODTW) and 
the Greedy Backward Alignment method(GBA), 
reimplementing the design of the real-time music tracking module and 
enhancing some blocks. 
In practical tests, the real-time music tracking system exhibited 
low latency and accurate tracking performance, 
maintaining stable tracking effects under different features.
